Clever, thoughtful, wonderful ****:
Happy birthday. May your dearest wishes come true. 

This is for you. 
Each frame was drawn with a mouse in microsoft paint.
The files are aptly named "AI" because the source is Alex and the destination is Incy.

PLEASE CLICK MAXIMISE at the command terminal during runtime.

I was inspired by your birthday gift. 
Warning: my commenting in the python files will also burn your eyes.
You can check out my code if you want, namely the png2ascii.py i wrote to convert png files into ascii text.
I first tried drawing you in ascii directly and it was... you came out looking like demonic Chara.
