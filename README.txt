******, ***********, ********* ****:
Happy birthday. *** **** ******* ****** **** ****. 

This is for you. 
Each frame was drawn with a mouse in microsoft paint.
The files are aptly named "AI" because *** ****** ** **** *** *** destination ** ****.

Have everything in the same folder, then double click AI.py to run.
PLEASE CLICK MAXIMISE at the command terminal during runtime.

I was inspired by your birthday gift. 
Warning: my commenting in the python files will also burn your eyes.
You can check out my code if you want, namely the png2ascii.py i wrote to convert png files into ascii text.
I first tried drawing you in ascii directly and it was... you came out looking like demonic Chara.
